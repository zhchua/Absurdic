# Absurdic
Be warned: I'm a rust beginner, use with extreme caution

An attempt at a JRecord-analogue in Rust. \
Preferably with better documentation of course.

## Usage/Copying/whatever
Do whatever you want with this

## Eh

### What
1. Given a copybook and binary data file, produce a matching readable ascii output (either fixed length or csv)
2. Accommodate for at least fixed length records and comp-3 numeric data

### Why
- For fun
- There's jrecord in java but not for rust... and I'm sick of both at work

### When
- Whenever. Work gets in the way, as does my chubby pillow

### How
- Parse the damned things
